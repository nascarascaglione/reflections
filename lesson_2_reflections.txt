What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

As of now, it's the only way I know to add new directories to use in Git from the command line.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area takes a snapshot of the working directory, but doesn't just throw it in the repository for everyone to see.  It's almost an "Are you sure?" moment for a developer so that they don't have to commit everything immediately.
